# PyNeuralNet
A python library for Artificial Neural Networks

PyNeuralNet is a python library to implement Artificial Neural Networks for classification and regression with a few lines of code and it is thought to be as easy to use as possible.

It consists of two modules:
* `layer.py` where the different types of layer are defined.
* `neuralnet.py` where the object `NeuralNet` (feed-forward neural network) and all the main methods are defined. 

At the moment, only feed-forward neural networks with full connectivity between layers can be implemented.
